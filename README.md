This was my first College Project using GUI Programming.

A company has contacted you asking you to develop a system that can be rolled out a technical support team. Currently they are using a paper based system and they often notice that a number of pieces of information become lost a and the company is never sure if the customer help ticket has been solved.

In the company there are three different roles in  company which should be mirrored in your system these include:

- Tech Support Member – A person who is responsible for reading the ticket and dealing with the customer. Once they are finished with the ticket they often mark it with a “Close” to say the customer has been dealt with correctly.
- Manager – The manager is not concerned about each individual ticket, but they do want to know the overall statistics about the tickets. They would like to see what time the ticket was opened and what time the ticket was closed. In additional to this, they want to see how many different tickets were allocated to each different team member to monitor their productivity.
- System Admin – The admin of the system is responsible for listing all of the accounts that ae in the system. They have the ability to change the usernames and password of tech support team members and also the project manager.
*It is just a prototype, this project has some bugs.
